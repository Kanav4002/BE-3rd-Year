/*
  Modules are reusable code that can be used in other files.
  Node.js has built-in module system based on CommonJS.

  Core Modules: Built-in, like path for handling file paths.
  Local Modules: Ones you create.
  Third-party Modules: Installed via npm (more than later).

  To use a module, you require it and can export functions or variables from it.

/*
  Package Managers
  The main package manager for Node.js is npm (Node Package Manager). 
  It comes bundled with Node.js and lets you install, manage, and share JavaScript packages (libraries). 
  Yarn is another option, but npm is the default.

  package.json: A file that tracks your project's dependencies and scripts.
  Commands: npm init to create package.json, npm install to add packages.

  Global vs. Local: Install globally for command-line tools (e.g., npm install -g nodemon), locally for project-specific ones.

  npm init -y  // Creates package.json with defaults
  npm install lodash // (a utility library)
